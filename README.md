## Experiment 11

## Aim:
To study and implement Classes and Objects

## Theory: 
Classes:
Definition: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (data members) and behaviors (member functions or methods) that the objects created from the class will have.

object:
Definition: An object is an instance of a class. When you create an object, you are creating a specific example of the class, with its own set of data.

## Conclusion:

In C++, classes and objects are central to the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, providing a robust framework for organizing and managing complex systems. A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects, encapsulating data and functions into a single, cohesive unit. This encapsulation is a core principle of OOP, ensuring that the internal workings of a class are hidden from the outside world, thus promoting data abstraction and security. By defining classes, programmers can create well-structured, modular code that is easier to understand, maintain, and reuse.

Objects, which are instances of classes, represent real-world entities with states and behaviors. These states are captured through attributes (variables), and behaviors are defined by methods (functions). When an object is created, a constructor is typically invoked to initialize its attributes, setting up the initial state. Similarly, a destructor is called when the object is destroyed, handling any necessary cleanup, such as deallocating memory. This automatic management of resources helps prevent issues like memory leaks and ensures that objects operate smoothly throughout their lifecycle.
